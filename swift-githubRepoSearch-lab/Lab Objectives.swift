// Lab Objectives:

// The goal is to search for repositories on Github and display the results in your tableview. The user will tap a UIBarButtonItem such as Search to display a UIAlertController containing a UITextField prompting the user to enter a query. The controller should include two UIAlertActions - one to initiate the search and one to cancel (i.e. dismiss the UIAlertController). After the search is complete, the alert controller should be dismissed and the tableview should be reloaded with the search results. Use Alamofire instead of NSURLSession to make your network calls.

// Instructions:

// 1. Bring over your code from the github-repo-starring lab.
// 2. Write a method in GithubAPIClient that searches a repo from the text provided in the alert controller (which you will create). Take a look at the repo search documentation and implement the appropriate method to do a search for repositories.
// 3. Add a UIBarButtonItem (with to your TableViewController in Storyboard. When a user taps the button, it should display a UIAlertController that prompts the user to enter a search query. Add a UIAlertAction to initiate the search. This is my favorite resource on UIAlertController.
// 4. Re-implement the getRepositories and star/unstar methods using Alamofire instead of NSURLSession. If you didn't complete the Github Repo Starring lab, reference those instructions implementing the methods using Alamofire.
// Hint: The JSON object that you serialize in your API Client contains more JSON objects. In you data store, iff you iterate through the JSON object that you receive back from the API client, you will be able to access those sub-objects. Assuming that the sub-objects are named json, each sub-object contains an index (which can be accessed by json.0) and the actual value (which can be accessed by json.1 - in the case of this lab, json.1 will give you a dictionary). When you have the dictionary that you need, you can access the values in those dictionaries like this: dictionary["full_name"].string (substituting the correct value type for string`.
